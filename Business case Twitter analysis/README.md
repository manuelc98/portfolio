# Digital Marketing case
## Analysis of Rogue Artists Ensemble Twitter followers

#### Context
Rogue Artists Ensemble is a non profitable theatre association. As they rely mostly on donations, their digital strategy must be strong. That's why they requested the help of emlyon students in an Advanced Digital Marketing course I took. In order to have a guideline for our digital strategy I decided to analyse their Twitter followers data.

### Main tasks
* Python script to scrape Twitter data with Twitter API : csv file with location and biography of any account followers.
* Data cleaning : Normalize locations and raise trends
* Text analysis using NLTK : provide a portrait of Twitter followers
* Business recommendations relying on previous data insights
