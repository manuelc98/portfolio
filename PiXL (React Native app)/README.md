## PiXL : the secure second-hand phones marketplace
Currently, mobile phones market is composed of 3 main sectors : brand new, refurbished and second-hand.
If you want to get a fine mobile phone without spending too much and limiting your carbon footprint, you can seek for refurbished or second-hand phones.
While refurbished remains a very good option, we noticed that sellers did not get the best of their phone value and second-hand market was not safe enough for buyers.
So we designed our solution : a C2C marketplace specialized in premium and fully functional mobile phones.
Our added value :
- A secure marketplace : money is kept by our service during the transfer and released when the buyer confirms good reception.
- A compulsory test for sellers : all the functionalities of the phone are tested directly.
- Safety first : phones are tracked thanks to IMEI n° from test on seller side to resception on buyer side. Our deep learning image recognition algorithm ensures that the ohysical state of the phone is consistent with given description.
- Advice and best value for buyers and sellers : AI powered price recommendation, smart filters
